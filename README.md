# reSpeaker Lite Arduino Library

This library is based on [pschatzmann/arduino-audio-tools](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-tools) and changed according to Seeed Studio reSpeaker Lite, and is now officially available for Arduino. The supported esp-arduino is 3.0.x or higher.

For more detailed tutorials and introductions to reSpeaker Lite read the Seeed Studio [Wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reSpeaker_lite_introduction/).

## Installation in Arduino

You can download the library as zip and call include Library -> zip library. Or you can git clone this project into the Arduino libraries folder e.g. with

```
cd  ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries
git clone https://github.com/limengdu/reSpeaker_Lite-Arduino-Library.git
```

I recommend to use git because you can easily update to the latest version just by executing the ```git pull``` command in the project folder.
